<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<!--Paragraphs-->
<p>As I continue on my artistic journey, I have been figuring out my artistic style and how I want to present my work. The Covid 19 pandemic has affected all of us in many ways, and it continues to do so. As time passes all I can see is change. As time passes I have been forced to find myself in my thoughts and take the time to sit back and notice the change. My Art piece title “change” is a digitally composed image that was constructed using the techniques I learned in my digital art class. Using found images and online software, I wanted to create an image that captures the idea of change. Change is a scary concept, and many people fear the idea that something they are familiar with is changing. As stated earlier, so much has changed since the introduction of covid. Life as we knew it was gone and we had to adapt and change to accommodate what was going on. To this day many lives have been turned upside down and continue to alter. As time goes on I am constantly reminded of the changes that occur in my day to day. Life is all about transformation and transition. Nobody is the same that they were the day before. Whether we change for the better or for the worse, it is vital that we recognize these changes so that we can transform and transition into the next stages of life.</p>

<h2>Concepts and Techniques:</h2>

	<p>As stated earlier, my piece title “Change” is a digitally composed image that I made using multiple techniques from my Art 74 class this semester. The concept behind the piece was to have 3 altered pictures originating from one image, then use the collection of images to piece together one cohesive image. In order to do this I needed the programs Adobe Photoshop and Audacity. The image I chose to edit was an image of the Earth for a couple of reasons. The first reason why I wanted to alter an image of the Earth was because of how familiar we all are with it. All of us are content with our beautiful planet, however it is hard for us to notice the real change that happens everyday. Our changing planet represents myself and my struggle to properly notice how I change.  I want the viewer to feel uncomfortable and challenge their own perspective on change. The second reason why I chose to edit the image of Earth was because it is something that connects all of us together. As humans we evolved and developed drastically in hundreds of thousands of years, yet I feel that we rarely question the minute alterations and changes we make everyday. During this difficult time many of us are living day by day and fail to realize our own improvement. As people look at my artwork I want them to feel connected to everyone on the planet. I want them to see the change in the images and reflect on how not only we all are developing, but also how they are developing. Whether we change mentally, physically, spiritually, or culturally, we can not diminish the fact that we all change. </p>

 <p>Audacity is an audio editing software that allows the user to alter audio files as well as modify the code of images. In order to alter images, I first needed to convert my original image into a tiff file, or the raw data of the image. I then moved the new tiff file over into audacity by importing the raw data of the image (tiff file). In order to produce the glitches and weird alterations you can see, I added effects to the audio of the image. Using different effects such as distortion, echo, invert, and so much more I had my manipulated images to use for my collage in Adobe Photoshop. Adobe Photoshop was used in this artwork to allow me to get all of those images together and all parts of the composition. I first started by adding a layer for each image that I had. The next steps are fairly simple because all I did was transform, crop, and resize the images until I was satisfied with the final composition of the work. Once I am pleased I then move on to combining all of the layers that I had for each of the altered images I made earlier. At this point I was really happy with the product, and I feel that the final product serves its purpose helping me to convey my message of change.</p>
