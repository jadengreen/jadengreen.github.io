<h2>What Does it Mean to be and Artist?</h2>

<!--Paragraphs-->
<p>I really began my artistic journey at the beginning of my first year at San Jose State University. I was introduced to videography and visual editing, and was immediately hooked. A little over a year after making my first video, today I do not consider myself an artist. This is because most of the videos I make  fail to convey a message. I think the key to being an artist is being able to communicate messages with your art.  I believe that any can make art because art at the most basic definition is just visual expression. I also believe that the distinction between making art and calling one an artist is to have a message and the ability to express said message. One tool that makes it easier for artists to communicate their messages is Artist Statements. Artist Statements are clear bodies of text written by the artist that not only describe the piece, but also bring some context that the audience may not have gotten by just looking at the artwork. Most of the time, an artist's statement is explicit in saying the meaning behind the work, or the reason why the work was created. Artist statements are a crucial element to help artist reveal whatever message they want their viewers to grasp.  As I began taking more art classes, I began to understand the importance of meaning in art. Whether it is your reason for making the piece or what you want your viewer to leave with after looking at your work, there is added value when there is purpose. As I continue making things and going through my artistic journey, I want to continue to work on having a reason for making what I am making. </p>
